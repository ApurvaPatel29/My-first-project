# My-first-project
This is my first project on data analysis and visualization.
In this project, I performed data analysis and visualization on datasets about Twitter US Airline Sentiment which I got from KAGGLE.
In this project, I use Python, Pandas, streamlit, plotlyexpress.

#to run this program you have to install the Streamlit package from pip or Anaconda depending on which interpreter you have on your system.

Run the main_program.py using STREAMLIT RUN MAIN_PROGRAM.PY in the console.
